OMO Issues
----------

[ ]Keep queue list tags updated.

   [ ]When editing tags, the new tags need to be displayed upon okaying them.

   [ ]Tags need to be updated with the info from the library if the library
      gets finished loading.

[ ]Fix queue list not scrolling to keep up with the currently playing queue
   item. If the current item is on screen when it finishes playing,
   automatically scroll the list to put the new current item at the top if the
   current item is now past the bottom of the visible part of the list.

[ ]Improve default theme button graphics.

[ ]Implement window constraints. Use theme data to calculate a good minimum
   window size.

[ ]Add more detailed scanning info to the library view. Show which file is
   currently being scanned and total progress.

[ ]Don't require user to select a library folder if they press L and haven't
   set a library folder yet.

[ ]Show text indicating no library has been set up in library view when
   appropriate.

[ ]Ensure we are spawning the library scanning thread in all places the library
   setup routing is being called.

[ ]Fix queue list display swapping album and title.

[ ]See if we can add some stuff to info.plist to make associating music files
   with OMO work correctly.
