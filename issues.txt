OMO Issues
----------

v0.4
----

[ ]Implement tags submission and retrieval.


v0.3
----

[ ]Implement track split dialog and tag system. We need a way to store track
   split data in the base file's metedata so we can keep it in the online
   database instead of requiring each user to split tracks on their own.

[ ]Implement track looping.

   [ ]Add codec handler function for setting up the loop for a loaded track.
      The codec handler will be responsible for keeping track of this data and
      ensuring playback respects the passed loop settings.

[ ]Implement font size override. The user should be able to specify a preferred
   font size to override a theme's font size. This override should cause the
   theme system to load the font in the correct size so we get a properly sized
   font throughout the GUI system.

[ ]Save queue data on exit and reload on open so users can continue where they
   left off.


v0.2
----

[X]Fix queue list display swapping album and title.

[X]Fix queue list not scrolling to keep up with the currently playing queue
   item. If the current item is on screen when it finishes playing,
   automatically scroll the list to put the new current item at the top if the
   current item is now past the bottom of the visible part of the list.

[X]Don't require user to select a library folder if they press L and haven't
   set a library folder yet.

[X]Show text indicating no library has been set up in library view when
   appropriate.

[X]Ensure we are spawning the library scanning thread in all places the library
   setup routing is being called.

[X]Keep queue list tags updated.

   [X]When editing tags, the new tags need to be displayed upon okaying them.

   [X]Tags need to be updated with the info from the library if the library
      gets finished loading.

[X]Specify where archive handlers extract files to. We need the library scanner
   to extract to a different location than the player so we don't get conflicts
   that cause playback or scanning errors.

[X]Get tags for queued files using codec handler if library has not been loaded
   yet.

[ ]Improve default theme button graphics.

[ ]Implement window constraints. Use theme data to calculate a good minimum
   window size.

[ ]Add more detailed scanning info to the library view. Show which file is
   currently being scanned and total progress.

[ ]See if we can add some stuff to info.plist to make associating music files
   with OMO work correctly.

[ ]Add 'Shuffle All' item to song list.

[ ]Allow Shift+Double-Click to add items to the queue instead of replacing it.

[ ]Update menus to include items for all current functionality.
