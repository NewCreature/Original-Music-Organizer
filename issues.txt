OMO Issues
----------

v0.4
----

[ ]Implement tags submission and retrieval.


v0.3
----

[ ]Implement track split dialog and tag system. We need a way to store track
   split data in the base file's metedata so we can keep it in the online
   database instead of requiring each user to split tracks on their own.

[ ]Implement track looping.

   [ ]Add codec handler function for setting up the loop for a loaded track.
      The codec handler will be responsible for keeping track of this data and
      ensuring playback respects the passed loop settings.

[ ]Implement font size override. The user should be able to specify a preferred
   font size to override a theme's font size. This override should cause the
   theme system to load the font in the correct size so we get a properly sized
   font throughout the GUI system.

[ ]Save queue data on exit and reload on open so users can continue where they
   left off.

[ ]Split off library list generation from library loading. We should be able to
   use library features that aren't tied to the artist, album, and song lists
   without waiting for those to generate. We should, of course, perform this
   function in a separate thread so we can continue to use the program while
   the lists generate.

[ ]Add status bar to library view. We should show library-related messages in
   this status bar instead of using the list box.

[ ]Split queue list and player controls into separate modules so we can make a
   compact view.

[ ]Add volume and seek controls to the player module.

[ ]Add song info to the player module. The plan is to have 2 lines for this,
   one line for the artist, title, etc. of the currently playing song and
   another for track-specific info from the codec handler.


v0.2
----

[X]Fix queue list display swapping album and title.

[X]Fix queue list not scrolling to keep up with the currently playing queue
   item. If the current item is on screen when it finishes playing,
   automatically scroll the list to put the new current item at the top if the
   current item is now past the bottom of the visible part of the list.

[X]Don't require user to select a library folder if they press L and haven't
   set a library folder yet.

[X]Show text indicating no library has been set up in library view when
   appropriate.

[X]Ensure we are spawning the library scanning thread in all places the library
   setup routing is being called.

[X]Keep queue list tags updated.

   [X]When editing tags, the new tags need to be displayed upon okaying them.

   [X]Tags need to be updated with the info from the library if the library
      gets finished loading.

[X]Specify where archive handlers extract files to. We need the library scanner
   to extract to a different location than the player so we don't get conflicts
   that cause playback or scanning errors.

[X]Get tags for queued files using codec handler if library has not been loaded
   yet.

[X]Add more detailed scanning info to the library view. Show which file is
   currently being scanned and total progress.

[X]Add 'Shuffle All' item to song list.

[X]Allow Shift+Double-Click to add items to the queue instead of replacing it.

[X]Implement window constraints. Use theme data to calculate a good minimum
   window size.

[X]Figure out why window position settings aren't restored properly when
   switching back to player-only view.

[X]Update menus to include items for all current functionality.

[X]See if we can add some stuff to info.plist to make associating music files
   with OMO work correctly.

[X]Update version numbers.

[X]Update changelog.

[ ]Improve default theme button graphics.
