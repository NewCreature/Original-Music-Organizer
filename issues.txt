[ ]Keep queue list tags updated.

   [ ]When editing tags, the new tags need to be displayed upon okaying them.

   [ ]Tags need to be updated with the info from the library if the library
      gets finished loading.

[ ]Fix queue list not scrolling to keep up with the currently playing queue

   automatically scroll the list to put the new current item at the top if the
