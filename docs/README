Original Music Organizer
------------------------

Note: this program is in early development. The current version is very minimal
and is only able to do basic playback of files in supported formats (see below
for a list of supported formats).

To-do:

    Implement playback queue.
    Implement player UI.
    Implement library.
    Implement tag editor.
    Implement tag scraper.
    Add support for multiple songs in a single file/archive.
    Add support for more formats.


Supported Formats
-----------------

OMO currently supports playing back files in these formats on all supported
platforms: MOD, S3M, XM, IT, WAV, OGG, and FLAC.

Additional support for these formats is available on MacOS: MP2, MP3, MP4, M4A,
AAC, and MID.

Supported for more formats on all platforms will be added in the future.


Description
-----------

The goal of this project is to provide a way to organize and play back your
entire music collection. I grew up listening to music on a computer and have a
large collection of music in various formats. In the past I had used Winamp for
its extensive support for audio formats through input plugins.

Since moving away from Windows several years ago, I've not really had a good
way to play back a large portion of my music collection. I seek to change that
situation with Original Music Organizer. That music disk I downloaded from a
BBS 25 years ago will live happily alongside that album I downloaded from
Amazon last week.

OMO will leverage the power of the Internet to help you organize your
collection by pulling tags submitted by others. Tag your own untagged music and
submit those tags so others don't have to duplicate the work.


Installation
------------

Instructions will be added once we get the project far enough along to be able
to provide packages.


Getting Started
---------------

The current version only supports the ability to browse your files and select
music. To play back a song, simply open it with the file select dialog. Once a
song is playing, you can pause and resume it with the playback menu.
